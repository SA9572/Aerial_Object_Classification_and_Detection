### Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution that can classify aerial images into two categories — Bird or Drone — and optionally perform object detection to locate and label these objects in real-world scenes.

The solution will help in security surveillance, wildlife protection, and airspace safety where accurate identification between drones and birds is critical. The project involves building a Custom CNN classification model, leveraging transfer learning, and optionally implementing YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. The final solution will be deployed using Streamlit for interactive use.

### Real-Time Business Use Cases

1. Wildlife Protection
   - Detect birds near wind farms or airports to prevent accidents.
2. Security & Defense Surveillance
   - Identify drones in restricted airspace for timely alerts.
3. Airport Bird-Strike Prevention
   - Monitor runway zones for bird activity.
4. Environmental Research
   - Track bird populations using aerial footage without misclassification.

## Project Workflow

1. Understand the Dataset
   - Inspect dataset folder structure
   - Check number of images per class
   - Identify class imbalance
   - Visualize sample images

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
   - Resize images to a fixed size (224×224 for classification)

3. Data Augmentation
   - Apply transformations: rotation, flipping, zoom, brightness, cropping

4. Model Building (Classification)
   - Custom CNN: Conv layers, pooling, dropout, batch normalization, dense output layer
   - Transfer Learning: Load models like ResNet50, MobileNet, EfficientNetB0 and fine-tune

5. Model Training
   - Train both models
   - Use EarlyStopping & ModelCheckpoint
   - Track metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

6. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluate test results with confusion matrix & classification report
   - Plot accuracy/loss graphs

7. Model Comparison
   - Compare accuracy, training time, and generalization performance
   - Save the best performing model for Streamlit deployment

## Optional: Object Detection with YOLOv8

Steps:

1. Install YOLOv8.
2. Prepare dataset (images and YOLOv8-format .txt labels — already done).
3. Create a `data.yaml` configuration file for YOLOv8.
4. Train the YOLOv8 model.
5. Validate the trained model.
6. Run inference on test or new images.

## Streamlit Deployment

- Create a simple UI with image upload
- Display prediction (Bird / Drone) & confidence score
- (Optional) Show YOLOv8 detection results with bounding boxes

## Project Deliverables

1. Trained models (Custom CNN, Transfer Learning, YOLOv8 (optional))
2. Streamlit app for classification/detection
3. Scripts & notebooks for preprocessing, training, evaluation
4. Model comparison report
5. GitHub repository with documentation
6. Well-structured, commented code
7. Video
